# Neural Pathway Pylance Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
All Pylance type errors in the neural pathway test file have been successfully resolved. The granular neural pathway system is now fully operational with proper type safety and FSOT 2.0 compliance.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Neuron Type Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: `FSNeuron` constructor expected `neuron_type: str` but test was passing `NeurotransmitterType` enum values
**Solution**: Updated test to pass appropriate neuron type strings:
- `NeurotransmitterType.DOPAMINE` → `"dopaminergic"`
- `NeurotransmitterType.SEROTONIN` → `"pyramidal"`
- `NeurotransmitterType.GABA` → `"interneuron"`
- `NeurotransmitterType.ACETYLCHOLINE` → `"pyramidal"`
- `NeurotransmitterType.GLUTAMATE` → `"pyramidal"`

### 2. FSOT 2.0 Foundation Bug
**Problem**: `phase_variance` variable was defined inside `if observed:` block but used outside of it
**Solution**: Moved `phase_variance = -mp.cos(c.THETA_S + c.PI)` outside the conditional block

### 3. Inter-Pathway Connection Initialization
**Problem**: `KeyError` when connecting pathways that weren't created through `create_pathway` method
**Solution**: Added initialization check in `connect_pathways` method:
```python
if source_pathway not in self.inter_pathway_connections:
    self.inter_pathway_connections[source_pathway] = []
```

### 4. Dimensional Efficiency Domain Violation
**Problem**: `dimensional_efficiency = 14` violated AI_TECH domain limits [11, 13]
**Solution**: Changed to `dimensional_efficiency = 13` to comply with FSOT 2.0 constraints

==============================================================
Date: 2025-09-04
Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üéØ ISSUES ADDRESSED

### **Pylance Attribute Access Errors Fixed:**

1. **`_update_goals` method missing**
   - **Problem**: Method called in `_process_cognitive_signal` but not defined
   - **Solution**: Implemented full goal management functionality
   - **Features**: Add, remove, update goals with proper tracking

2. **`_apply_inhibition` method missing**
   - **Problem**: Method called in `_process_executive_signal` but not defined
   - **Solution**: Implemented inhibitory control system
   - **Features**: Target-specific inhibition with strength and duration

3. **`_executive_override` method missing**
   - **Problem**: Method called in `_process_executive_signal` but not defined
   - **Solution**: Implemented executive override mechanism
   - **Features**: High-priority intervention with proper authority tracking

4. **`_provide_status` method missing**
   - **Problem**: Method called in `_process_executive_signal` but not defined
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive status reporting
   - **Features**: Full executive summary with metrics and state

5. **`_retrieve_from_working_memory` method missing**
   - **Problem**: Method called in `_process_memory_signal` but not defined
   - **Solution**: Implemented working memory retrieval system
   - **Features**: Key-based and pattern-based memory search

6. **`_clear_working_memory` method missing**
   - **Problem**: Method called in `_process_memory_signal` but not defined
   - **Solution**: Implemented memory cleanup functionality
   - **Features**: Selective and bulk memory clearing options

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Goal Management System (`_update_goals`)**
```python
- Add new goals to current_goals list
- Remove specific goals by ID or name
- Update existing goal parameters
- Maintain max_goals limit (5 goals)
- Return status and updated goal list
```

### **Inhibitory Control (`_apply_inhibition`)**
```python
- Store inhibition signals with target, strength, duration
- Track inhibition timestamps for expiration
- Generate high-priority response signals
- Maintain inhibition_signals dictionary
```

### **Executive Override (`_executive_override`)**
```python
- Apply immediate executive intervention
- Support stop, pause, redirect actions
- Generate urgent priority signals
- Record override history with authority
```

### **Status Reporting (`_provide_status`)**
```python
- Comprehensive executive state summary
- Working memory usage metrics
- Active goals and recent decisions
- Inhibition targets and activation levels
- Timestamped status data
```

### **Memory Retrieval (`_retrieve_from_working_memory`)**
```python
- Direct key-based item retrieval
- Pattern-matching search across memory
- Access count tracking for items
- Multiple retrieval modes (key, pattern, all)
```

### **Memory Cleanup (`_clear_working_memory`)**
```python
- Clear all items or specific scope
- Remove expired items based on duration
- Clear individual items by key
- Provide detailed cleanup feedback
```

## üß™ TESTING RESULTS

**Test Script**: `test_frontal_cortex_fixes.py`
**Results**: 
- ‚úÖ Import & Methods: PASS (All 6 methods present)
- ‚úÖ Functionality: PASS (Decision making, memory, executive functions)
- ‚úÖ Signal Processing: PASS (All signal types handled)

**Test Coverage**:
```
‚úÖ Decision making with multiple options
‚úÖ Working memory storage and retrieval
‚úÖ Executive status reporting
‚úÖ Goal management operations
‚úÖ Inhibitory control application
‚úÖ Executive override mechanisms
```

## üìä BEFORE vs AFTER

### Before:

- ‚úÖ Complete executive control functionality
- ‚úÖ Full working memory management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive goal tracking system
- ‚úÖ Robust inhibitory control
- ‚úÖ Executive override capabilities
- ‚úÖ Clean code without Pylance warnings

## üéØ FUNCTIONALITY ADDED

1. **Enhanced Executive Control**
   - Decision making with confidence scoring
   - Plan creation and goal management
   - Inhibitory control and override systems

2. **Advanced Working Memory**
   - Storage with automatic cleanup
   - Flexible retrieval (key, pattern, bulk)
   - Access tracking and expiration

3. **Comprehensive Status Monitoring**
   - Real-time executive state reporting
   - Performance metrics and summaries
   - Historical decision tracking

4. **Neuromorphic Signal Processing**
   - Proper response to all signal types
   - FSOT scalar integration for decisions
